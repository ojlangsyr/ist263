My name is Oliver Lang, I transferred into information studies only this semester as a sophomore.
My chosen major is Info Mgmt & Tech.
I am interested in learning SQL to interact with databases and hopefully become successful through it.
I don't really have any notable accomplishments, I mean Syracuse itself is probably top of the list.
Most of my time is spent playing video games, hanging out with friends, or just wasting it.
I frequent Counter Strike, but recently have picked up factorio, and so far it's pretty adddictive.
I am looking forward to become more adept with coding languages as the semester goes on.
