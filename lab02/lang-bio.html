        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Oliver Lang, I transferred into information studies only this semester as a sophomore. My chosen major is <strong>Info Mgmt & Tech</strong>. I am interested in learning SQL to interact with databases and hopefully become successful through it. I don't really have any notable accomplishments, I mean Syracuse itself is probably top of the list. I am looking forward to become more adept with coding languages as the semester goes on.</p>
        <p>Most of my time is spent playing video games, hanging out with friends, or just wasting it. My affinity for games and technology started early on, before I was old enough to play games myself I would watch my older brother play, my first memory is actually watching him play metroid on the gamecube. Later I would go on to build my own computer in middle school after saving up the money for 8 years, and researching for three months how the parts functioned. To say the least I am technologically inclined.

        <li>Counter Strike Global Offensive</li>
        <li>Factorio</li>
        <li>LOL</li>
       </ul>
