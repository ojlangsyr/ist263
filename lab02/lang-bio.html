        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Oliver Lang, I transferred into information studies only this semester as a sophomore. My chosen major is Info Mgmt & Tech. I am interested in learning SQL to interact with databases and hopefully become successful through it. I don't really have any notable accomplishments, I mean Syracuse itself is probably top of the list.</p>
        <p>Most of my time is spent playing video games, hanging out with friends, or just wasting it. I frequent <strong>Counter Strike</strong> but recently have picked up factorio, and so far it's pretty adddictive. I am looking forward to become more adept with coding languages as the semester goes on.
